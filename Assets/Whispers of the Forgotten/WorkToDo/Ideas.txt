BUGS:

After hitting something like puzzel the player can use WASD and still move this needs to be fixed -> FIX
Hitting the wall with axe the sound is before the hit should be fix - Needs to be fixed
Sometimes again you can fall under the map - Changed some Project Settings
Text in Stories to be written with animation to be more cool - Fix
